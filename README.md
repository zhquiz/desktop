## Speech (text-to-speech, TTS)

By default, the app will try to use Google TTS, if online and available.

However, for offline, it will fallback to operating system's default TTS.

- For Windows, you will also need to install Chinese Language Support.
- For macOS, you will need to enable Chinese voice (Ting-Ting) in accessibility.
- For Linux, you might need to install `espeak` and `speech-dispatcher`, if not preinstalled already.
